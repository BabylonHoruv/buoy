Buoy is a community-driven technology from top to bottom. Our team of core contributors are mostly based in the United States and care about a range of issues from alternative mental health and medical response, to domestic violence survivor support, to police and prison abolition. Although we don’t all share the exact same politics, we’ve come together as one group because we all agree that more has to be done to support communities of people who the current system fails, regardless of whether that failure is deliberate or not. 

In the spirit of [software development as direct action](https://unquietpirate.wordpress.com/2015/07/25/maximum-social-impact-minimum-lines-of-code-software-development-as-direct-action%E2%80%A8/), we set out to design and implement [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) that has the maximum social impact with the minimum lines of code, as quickly as possible.
