title: Hello, Earth angel

We're excited to announce the Better Angels blog. :)

Basically, people kept asking us where the "official" place was to get updates about the Better Angels and our projects, like [Buoy](https://meitar.github.io/better-angels). We kept being like, "Um, guiizzz, we don't do 'official.'" But look, we caved.

There's not much here and there may not be, but at least when we're asked "Where's do I get the latest news about Buoy?" we can answer, "Our blog!"

'Til next time.

No gods, no nations, no masters, no bosses,  
&mdash;The Better Angels
