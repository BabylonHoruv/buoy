# Better Angels' Buoy: A community-driven emergency first responder system.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/meitar/better-angels.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/meitar/better-angels)

Better Angels' *Buoy* is an app designed to quickly connect survivors of domestic or dating violence (DV) with trusted friends, family members, advocates, and other allies in times of crisis.

## For service providers

Anyone with a WordPress-powered website or blog can install the plugin to host an instance of the Buoy app for their community or constituents. Legal aid service providers, DV advocates, shelters, and other institutions can offer survivors one-click emergency access to a network of trusted peers and/or on-call emergency responders.

## For victims and survivors

With Buoy, you are never more than one button press away from the people you trust most. There is no additional software to download or install. Simply bookmark a page with your smartphone's built-in Web browser to gain instant access to your personal emergency response team. Quickly send them your location with a pre-defined custom message, or provide a per-alert message.

# Installing

Buoy is currently distributed as a WordPress plugin. Installation is as simply as pressing "Install now" from your admin WordPress Dashboard. You can also find [Buoy hosted on the WordPress plugin repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/buoy/).
