A community-driven emergency dispatch system. Buoy is a private, enhanced 9-1-1 for your community.

== Description ==

Buoy is a private, enhanced [9-1-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9-1-1) for your website designed to quickly connect people from your community who need help with trusted friends, family members, advocates, and other allies who can help them.

*For service providers*

Anyone with a WordPress-powered website or blog can install the plugin to host an instance of the Buoy app for their community or constituents. Legal aid service providers, domestic, dating, and intimate partner violence prevention advocates, shelters, social groups, alternative medical and mental health collectives, and others can offer members of their community one-click emergency access to a network of trusted peers and/or on-call emergency responders.

*For victims and survivors*

With Buoy, you are never more than one button press away from the people you trust most. There is no additional software to download or install. Simply bookmark a page with your smartphone's built-in Web browser to gain instant access to your personal emergency response team. Quickly send them your location with a pre-defined custom message, write a custom message, or schedule a timed alert (like a "safe call") for some time in the future.

The people you select as your emergency contacts ("response team") will get a notification showing them your location in the real world as well as the locations of any other responders to your call for help. If it's safe for you to do so, you can now coordinate with all responders in a live chat room, or responders can coordinate amongst themselves about how best to help you if you are unresponsive.

**See the [screenshots](https://wordpress.org/plugins/buoy/screenshots/) for an example walkthrough of how Buoy works.**

== Installation ==

Buoy can be installed automatically from the WordPress plugin repository by searching for "Buoy" in the "Add new plugin" screen of your WordPres admin site and clicking the "Install now" button.

Buoy can also be installed manually by following these instructions:

1. [Download the latest plugin code](https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/buoy.zip) from the WordPress plugin repository.
1. Upload the unzipped `buoy` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress installation.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

Once activated, each user who wants to use Buoy must define their personal response team (list their chosen emergency contacts) in the "My Team" settings page before they can actually send an alert. See the [screenshots](https://wordpress.org/plugins/buoy/screenshots/) for a brief walkthrough of how to configure Buoy after it is installed.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does Buoy track my location? =

No. Buoy never tracks or record your movements. The only time Buoy knows where you are is when you press the emergency alert button. Buoy then sends this information only to the people you added to your emergency response team.

= Should I only use Buoy in a real emergency? =

Although Buoy is designed to be useful in even the most phsyically high-risk situations such as domestic or dating violence abuses, kidnapping, home invasion, and other frightening scenarios, you can use Buoy however you want. We particularly encourage you to use Buoy when you feel like your situation may not rise to the level of calling 9-1-1 or when you feel like the presence of police officers will not improve the situation.

For instance:

* If you feel you are being followed as you walk home on campus, use Buoy. Your friends will be able to watch your location on their screens and quietly chat with you as you walk home, ensuring you reach your destination safely.
* If you or someone you are with feels suicidal, or has a bad trip, and you don't want cops showing up to your house but need assistance, use Buoy. Responders will be notified of your physical location and will be able to coordinate a response action with you and with each-other in real time without ever notifying the authorities of the situation.
* If you are with a group at an outing such as a hike or a large amusement park and get separated from your group, use Buoy. Each group member will be able to see one another's current location on a map, can easily coordinate where to meet up, and can even access turn-by-turn directions to one another's locations with one tap of your finger.

== Screenshots ==

1. The Buoy emergency alert screen. Use the larger button with a buoy icon to immediately send a new alert to your team. Use the smaller button with the chat bubble icon to write a custom alert message that will be sent to your team.

2. The "Choose your team members" page lets you determine who you want to notify in the event of a crisis.
