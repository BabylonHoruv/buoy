Buoy is a free and open source, decentralized tool designed to quickly connect users with trusted friends, family members, advocates, and other allies in times of need.

Buoy allows users to pre-define a custom network of trusted friends and allies. In an emergency, the user's Response Team can be alerted with one touch. Each crisis alert provides Responders with a real-time map of the Alerter's and each others' locations, a chat room in which they can all coordinate a response, and media (photo, video, audio) sharing capabilities.

Buoy is a decentralized technology, designed to be community owned and operated. The tool has a *huge* range of potential [use cases](https://github.com/betterangels/better-angels/wiki/Buoy-Use-Cases)&mdash;everything from street medics coordinating with each other during an action, to copwatching, to domestic violence survivor support, to single parents picking each others' kids up from school. Each instance of Buoy can be customized to the unique needs of the organization or community group that hosts it.

In order to make it as accessible as possible to admins and developers of various skill levels, Buoy is implemented as a WordPress plugin. It integrates with other free software projects and services, such as mapping with OpenStreetMap and video conferencing through Jitsi Meet, and offers advanced real-time location tracking and push notifications via HTML5 APIs.

We are dedicated to free and open source software principles, and believe in the importance of technically-implemented decentralization in order to equitably distribute power. We have an explicitly anti-capitalist, anti-oppression, prison abolitionist, pro-community agenda.
